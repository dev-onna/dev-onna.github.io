    <h1>Greetings! Welcome to My Online Profile</h1>

    
    <h2>Professional Bio & Interests</h2>

    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    <p>Dev-onna has many aspirations and professional ventures with a passion for coding, development and the fundamentals needed to understand and apply these skills in a career or business.</p>

    <p>Recently designed two online stores via e-commerce platforms using standard templates and the necessary components to create it. And i felt the crave to understand more, and develop and design something from scratch.</p>
    
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I'm Interested in all things hands-on, thats where i learn the most efficiently. I've always said that if i'm not given challenges or something is just too easy for me, then i don't take much from it; We learn better when we make mistakes and the failures teach you to try different ways of accomplishing your goals, thats if you dont let it get the best of you! So i love to create, from scratch and "DIY" everything.  Which is why i've created and designed an e-commerce business, where i hand-craft natural skin-care, and self-care essentials.</p>

    <p> I'm a DIY kind of person. And on this journey, i will continue to grow, learn the basic and fundamentals to anything i venture onto. And succeed</p>

    <h1>Goals & Aspirations</h1>

    <p>Continue to grow my businesses and career, learn, travel, focus on family, and my mental health. I am creating healthy habits and maintaining positive vibrations within my life and those around me. And most importantly, i'm being myself and an emotionally aware and supportive mother.</p>
