    <h1>Greetings! Welcome to My Unique Online Profile</h1>

    
    <h2>Professional Bio & Interests</h2>

    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    <p>Dev-onna has many aspirations and professional ventures with a passion for coding, web development and the fundamentals needed to understand and apply these skills.</p>

    <p>Recently Designed two online stores via e-commerce platforms using standard templates using the necessary components needed to create. And i felt the crave for the ***bread and butter*** and what it takes to buiLd and design a website from scratch.</p>
    
    <p>I'm Interested in all things hands-on, thats where i learn the most efficient. I always say if im not given challenge or something it too easy then i'm not really learning anything from it. So i love to create, from scratch and ***do-it-myself***; which is why one of the online stores i created and designed is dedicated to my small business venture, where i hand-craft personal, and skin-care essentials.</p>

    <p> I'm a DIY kind of person, and on this journey, i will continue to grow, learn the blueprint, bread and butter, or the meat and potatoes of any task i take on. Because in that proccess i gain so much **more**.</p>
